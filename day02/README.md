## Thoughts

I completed the challenges in Python. On the first day I used my text editor to format the string, but I wanted to use Python's built-in file reader to parse a text file containing the puzzle input. I also wanted to practice Regular Expressions so I solved the first challenge using RegEx to parse the input, even though the input was simple (and uniform) enough that it wasn't warranted. I used used a combination of list comprehension and the string.split() method for the second challenge, which would have been equally as appropriate for the first challenge.
