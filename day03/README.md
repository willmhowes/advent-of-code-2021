## Thoughts

I completed the challenges in Python. Input parsing was easy today because it was just a bunch of binary strings. The first challenge was reasonable enough but there was a lot going on in the second challenge. For this second problem, I tried to prioritize legibility and did my best to abstract the steps in a reasonable fashion. I'm very happy with the result!

UPDATE: I realized that my `calcFreq()` function in day03.2.py calculates the mode (or the opposite of mode) at every index position of the argument's binary strings when all that is used from that output is a single index. Thus, there is room for improvement.
