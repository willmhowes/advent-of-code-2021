## Thoughts

I completed the challenges in Python. Input parsing was easy today because it was just a bunch of binary strings. The first challenge was reasonable enough but there was a lot going on in the second challenge. For this second problem, I tried to prioritize legibility and did my best to abstract the steps in a reasonable fashion. I'm very happy with the result!
