## Thoughts

I completed the challenges in Python and SML NJ

UPDATE (12/04/2021): I stored the puzzle inputs for this day in pre-processed arrays within python and mips files because I did not want to deal with text file parsing yet. I did tackle text parsing with python on day02, but I'm not sure I'm on board with text parsing in SML "for fun"
